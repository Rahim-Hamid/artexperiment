Repository for code that generates some kind of art

p5proj folder is for projects made in p5.js - experimenting with trying to create repeated tesselations/patterns using the library - once the file is open in editor, right clicj the index.html file and run as live server

Strude REPL is a live music coding website based on a Javascript library, and the files in my folder are text files containing code that when run on the website will play music

The Pixelation project is able to take images and based on user input of block size produce varyingly pixelated images from an original image - the lower the block size, the greater the pixelation
Within this project, the mosaic.py file can take a target file and many other tile files and use the tile files to form "pixels" in an newly formed target image
